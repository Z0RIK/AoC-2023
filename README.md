# Advent of Code 2023

This is my first time participating in Advent of Code. The plan is to keep solutions in one file. Each file can be compiled into an executable. Parsing will be included in the program.

Executing binaries will look something like this:

```bash
./day_1.exe day_1_input.txt day_1_output.txt
```

The result will be displayed in the command line if no output file is provided.
